**Abstract and Scope :**

Stroke is a disease that affects the arteries leading to and within the brain. A stroke occurs when a blood vessel that carries oxygen and nutrients to the brain is either blocked by a clot or ruptures. According to the WHO, stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death worldwide.

Globally, 3% of the population are affected by subarachnoid hemorrhage, 10% with intracerebral hemorrhage, and the majority of 87% with ischemic stroke. 80% of the time these strokes can be prevented, so putting in place proper education on the signs of stroke is very important. The existing research is limited in predicting risk factors pertained to various types of strokes.

Early detection of stroke is a crucial step for efficient treatment and ML can be of great value in this process. To be able to do that, Machine Learning (ML) is an ultimate technology which can help health professionals make clinical decisions and predictions. During the past few decades, several studies were conducted on the improvement of stroke diagnosis using ML in terms of accuracy and speed.

The existing research is limited in predicting whether a stroke will occur or not.

Machine Learning techniques including  Random Forest, KNN ,  XGBoost , Catboost  and Naive Bayes have been used for prediction.Our work also determines the importance of the characteristics available and determined by the dataset.Our contribution can help predict early signs and prevention of this deadly disease.

**Feasibility Study**:

Stroke is among major causes of death and long-term disability worldwide. It is of great importance to predict the risk of having  a stroke for better prevention and early treatment. The goal of the Project is to develop a machine learning (ML) model to accurately and quickly predict whether or not a person suffered stroke based on the Kaggle stroke dataset . The dataset contains 43400 rows (samples) and 12 columns (variables), ten of which are used as the input variables and described in Table 1. The remaining two variables are ‘id’ (excluded from our experiments) which corresponds to patient’s ID and ‘stroke’ which has a value of 0 (no stroke) or 1 (stroke) and is used as the output variable (target). The dataset exhibits a highly imbalanced class with 97.88% corresponding to class 0 and only 2.12% corresponding to class 1. There exists missing values of 3.37% and 30.63% in ‘bmi’ and ’smoking\_status’ variables, respectively. In addition to providing performance benchmark across various ML models, this report also examines which features are useful for stroke prediction.

**1)Technical Feasibility –**

The main tools associated with this project are:

HTML,Css,Python.Diagram Drawing tools:Draw.io

Each of the technologies are freely available and the technical skills required are manageable. Initially the web site will be hosted in a free web hosting space, but for later implementations it will be hosted in a paid web hosting space with sufficient bandwidth. Bandwidth required in this application is very low, since it doesn't incorporate any multimedia aspect.

From these it's clear that the project is technically feasible.

**2) Financial Feasibility**

Being a web application it will have an associated hosting cost. Since the system doesn't consist of any multimedia data transfer, bandwidth required for the operation of this application is very low. The system will follow the freeware software standards. No cost will be charged from the potential customers. Bug fixes and maintaining tasks will have an associated cost. At the initial stage the potential market space will be the local universities and higher educational institutes. Beside the associated cost, there will be many benefits for the customers.

**3)Resource and Time Feasibility**

Resource feasibility Resources that are required for the project includes, Programming device (Laptop)

Hosting space (freely available)

Programming tools (freely available)

Programming individuals

So it's clear that the project has the required resource feasibility.

**Design Approach/ Methodology/ Planning of work** (should not exceed 1 page)

- The dataset for the project is taken from Kaggle.
- The data is then Pre Processed - removing N/A values, Normalizing the data, Removing extra/unwanted parameters.
- The data is then split into Training and Testing data in a 70-30 ratio.
- Multiple data models are formulated based on the training data .
- The models are applied on the testing dataset and the accuracy and performance metrics are calculated.
- Based on the performance metrics a Model is voted as the predictive model
- All future predictions are made based on this predictive model - whether a person will have a brain stroke or not based on the parameters entered.
